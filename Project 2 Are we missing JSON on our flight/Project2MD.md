|  1 | pig      |
|  2 | dog      |
|  3 | quetzal  |

#### Grand Question 3

*Question 2 needs a DESCRIPTION of what you learned and an EXAMPLE of your new data set. The EXAMPLE can be printed as a markdown table. (You do not have to include all the columns! That would not look good on the printed report.)*

#### Grand Question 4

*Question 2 needs a DESCRIPTION of what you learned and a CHART.*

#### Grand Question 5
